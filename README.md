# teleport-example

The goal of the code in this repository is to follow the documentation
in [Get Started with Teleport](https://goteleport.com/docs/) to launch a
demo cluster so that it can then be played with.

This is the Teleport Community Edition.

This is probably not for production use, since it is a single-instance
Teleport cluster.
